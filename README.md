# MazeCraft

This is a project on building a maze generator, as well as solving algorithm. The user interface is built in pygame in python. There are 5 generator and 3 solving algorithms, it is simple and fairly easy to play through. However, the code is quite unstable and vunerable to changes, any suggestions are welcome.

- Some of the simulations:
