# MazeCraft

This is a project on building a maze generator, as well as solving algorithm. The user interface is built in pygame in python. There are 5 generator and 3 solving algorithms, it is simple and fairly easy to play through. However, the code is quite unstable and vunerable to changes.

The main purpose of this is to get data of maze generator algorithm such as Time generated, Time solved, ...

It is really friendly-user and there is also an instruction on.

Some play through:
